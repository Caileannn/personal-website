                <p class="wText">(O)MACHINE is a real-time generative video, sound and text installation that explores the underlying processes and anthropomorphisation of artificial intelligence systems. The work observes an AI/Machine/Oracle, as it aimlessly traverses a virtual void in its digital body as the machine reflects on its existence and their role in the physical world.  </p>

                <p class="wText">The visuals, sound and text that are produced as part of the project are generative and processed in real-time. The architecture of the system was designed to emulate a stream of consciousness, created by a machine that is trapped in the never-ending cycle of reflection and feedback as a result of its constant interaction with the world, the by-product of the algorithm and its dataset. </p>

                <p class="wText">The project utilises open-source AI model for Natural Language Processing and TTS for text and speech synthesis such as GPT-Neo and Coqui-AI. The models are setup to produce novel block of text and speech in a continuous loop for the duration of the piece. The visuals are created in the same manner, using JavaScript libraries such as p5.js and Three.js to generate real-time animations for the digital body of the AI.</p>

                <p class="wText">The project takes inspiration from the concept of the “o-machine” or “oracle machine” that was proposed by Alan Turing as an alternative to the automatic machine that dominates computational world today. O-Machines can not complete a task automatically but waits for a decision to be made by “the oracle” – an unspecified entity – to continue forward. </p>
                <p class="wText">As questions begin to arise around the sentience of these *thinking* machines, it is important to explore this rapidly evolving relationship. By doing so, we might begin to expand the dynamics of this relationship and question how we can co-exist more harmoniously with other forms of intelligence through collaboration.</p>

                <p class="wText">By engaging with its output, it positions AI as both a subject and tool. In a hope to create discourse around the ethics of these systems and incentivise questions when attempting to understand how these systems function? How they think? If they even think at all? or can it help us think?</p>
